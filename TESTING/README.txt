TO RUN POSTMAN TESTS:
————————————————————
go to main page at https://final-project-186875.appspot.com
obtain 2 separate tokens and enter them for user1_token and user2_token in the environmental variables

alternatively, contact me to login to Google and provide the 2 tokens for my accounts (they expire unfortunately)

finally, set the time interval in the collection runner to 1000ms

Make sure to run the collection with the right environment set and those tokens copied over exactly.



TO VIEW POSTMAN TESTING WEB-ARCHIVE & DOCUMENTATION:
————————————————————————————————————————————————————

A final alternative, is to view the results published online by visiting:

https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2808890/cs496-final/7EBga6R#d40e6d22-2cbc-d029-da68-3475803a4db3

Postman graciously created this documentation based on my test collection. I’ve also provided a copy of the web archive in this TESTING folder.


Thank you!
